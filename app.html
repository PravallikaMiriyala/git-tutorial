This interface can typically be implemented by a user model class. For example, the following code shows how to implement this interface by a User ActiveRecord class:


$idParam public property
The session variable name used to store the value of $id.
public string $idParam = '__id'
$identity public property
The identity object associated with the currently logged-in user. null is returned if the user is not logged in (not authenticated).
public yii\web\IdentityInterface|null getIdentity ( $autoRenew = true )
public void setIdentity ( $identity )
