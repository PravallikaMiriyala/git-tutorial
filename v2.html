Implementing yii\web\IdentityInterface
The identity class must implement the yii\web\IdentityInterface which contains the following methods:

findIdentity(): it looks for an instance of the identity class using the specified user ID. This method is used when you need to maintain the login status via session.
findIdentityByAccessToken(): it looks for an instance of the identity class using the specified access token. This method is used when you need to authenticate a user by a single secret token (e.g. in a stateless RESTful application).
getId(): it returns the ID of the user represented by this identity instance.
getAuthKey(): it returns a key used to verify cookie-based login. The key is stored in the login cookie and will be later compared with the server-side version to make sure the login cookie is valid.
validateAuthKey(): it implements the logic for verifying the cookie-based login key.
If a particular method is not needed, you may implement it with an empty body. For example, if your application is a pure stateless RESTful application, you would only need to implement findIdentityByAccessToken() and getId() while leaving all other methods with an empty body.

In the following example, an identity class is implemented as an Active Record class associated with the user database table.

<?php

use yii\db\ActiveRecord;
use yii\web\IdentityInterface;

class User extends ActiveRecord implements IdentityInterface
{
    public static function tableName()
    {
        return 'user';
    }

    /**
     * Finds an identity by the given ID.
     *
     * @param string|int $id the ID to be looked for
     * @return IdentityInterface|null the identity object that matches the given ID.
     */
    public static function findIdentity($id)
    {
        return static::findOne($id);
    }

    /**
     * Finds an identity by the given token.
     *
     * @param string $token the token to be looked for
     * @return IdentityInterface|null the identity object that matches the given token.
     */
    public static function findIdentityByAccessToken($token, $type = null)
    {
        return static::findOne(['access_token' => $token]);
    }

    /**
     * @return int|string current user ID
     */
    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    /**
     * @return string current user auth key
     */
    public function getAuthKey()
    {
        return $this->auth_key;
    }

    /**
     * @param string $authKey
     * @return bool if auth key is valid for current user
     */
    public function validateAuthKey($authKey)
    {
        return $this->getAuthKey() === $authKey;
    }
}
As explained previously, you only need to implement getAuthKey() and validateAuthKey() if your application uses cookie-based login feature. In this case, you may use the following code to generate an auth key for each user and store it in the user table:
